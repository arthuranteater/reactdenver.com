### Notes

Use gatsby v1 by running $ gatsby run develop instead of $ gatsby develop.

Might need to run:
```
$ npm rebuild node-sass
```

### Access Locally
```
$ git clone https://github.com/[GITHUB_USERNAME]/[REPO_NAME].git
$ cd [REPO_NAME]
$ yarn
$ npm run develop
```
To test the CMS locally, you'll need run a production build of the site:
```
$ npm run build
$ npm run serve
```
